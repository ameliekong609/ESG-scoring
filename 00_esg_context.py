# MAGIC *The future of finance goes hand in hand with social responsibility, environmental stewardship and corporate ethics. 
# MAGIC In order to stay competitive, Financial Services Institutions (FSI)  are increasingly  disclosing more information 
# MAGIC about their environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. By better understanding and quantifying the 
# MAGIC sustainability and societal impact of any investment in a company or business, FSIs can mitigate reputation risk and 
# MAGIC maintain the trust with both their clients and shareholders. At Databricks, we increasingly hear from our customers 
# MAGIC that ESG has become a C-suite priority. This is not solely driven by altruism but also by economics: 
# MAGIC Higher ESG ratings are generally positively correlated with valuation and profitability while negatively correlated with 
# MAGIC volatility ([source](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/01/14/esg-matters/)). 
# MAGIC In this solution, we offer a novel approach to sustainable finance by combining NLP techniques and news analytics to 
# MAGIC extract key strategic ESG initiatives and learn companies' commitments to corporate responsibility.*
